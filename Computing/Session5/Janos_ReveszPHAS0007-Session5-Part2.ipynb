    "Remember, when dealing with data you should quote all uncertainties in your results to 1 significant figure, and then give your measured or calculated value to the same precision (see section 5.6 of the [PHAS0007 Data Analysis Handbook](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=16941)).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you want to do further calculations with your results, you should always use the numbers at their full calculated precision - hence the best general rule is to **_quote_ your results to 1 significant figure in the uncertainty, but always _calculate_ with the full number** to avoid any rounding errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any case, you will need to output your result to full precision at some point in order to determine how many significant figures are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if, for example, you've calculated your least-squares fit line to have a slope of 3.1234567 +/- 0.0023543, you should quote the result as 3.123 +/- 0.002 (not forgetting appropriate units, of course!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember though, you can't use LaTeX-style formatting in a python `print()` statement, only ASCII (or if you really feel the need, Unicode) characters. It's fine to use \"^\" to represent a superscript and \"+/-\" for $\\pm$, etc,  in print statements."

    "\n",
    "To put a text string with formatted numbers directly on your plot, you'll need to work out roughly the x- and y- coordinates where you want the text to start, then use a command like this:\n",

    "This particular simulation has measured how sodium ions diffuse through glass. An ion (or atom, or molecule) does not move through a substance (solid, liquid or gas) in a simple straight line, it is constantly colliding and bouncing off the other atoms it encounters on its path. If you look at the path of a single ion through the glass it would look like a random series of steps. This is basically the same phenomenon as Brownian motion, studied by Einstein in his 1905 PhD thesis. Einstein showed that the mean square displacement (MSD) (the average of the square of the distance travelled by the ion) is directly proportional to the elapsed time:\n",
